## Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open-source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.&#x20;
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.&#x20;
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.&#x20;
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
* Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## **Unacceptable Behavior**

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.&#x20;
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.&#x20;
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.&#x20;
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.&#x20;
* Unauthorized publication of private communication, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission. Any form of unwelcome attention or stalking. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## **Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.
